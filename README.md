# why2025 – G.R.A.P.P.A. Cluster Party Invite

## Project Description

A **C** application developed for the WHY2025 open-hardware badge — equipped with a display, keypad, LoRa module, and extensible architecture ([wiki.why2025.org](https://wiki.why2025.org/Team%3ABadge?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) — that displays an invitation to the “G.R.A.P.P.A. Cluster Party,” scheduled for **August 11, 2025**, during the WHY2025 camp.

## Current Status

Due to ESP-IDF build issues, the app was ready on BadgeHub in time for the event, in fact it would work on my computer, but not on the badge. Plans are in place to rebuild the toolchain on a clean machine for successful deployment.
